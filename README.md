3-IIS3DWB_Test not working !!!

4-Olmuyorr_DMA_DWB it works, takes data from IIS3DWB using DMA and print using uart2.

5-SPI2_MDA_Chain_2_Sensor it works, takes data both from IIS3DWB and ISM330DHCX using DMA and interrupt triggering and print using uart2

6-spi_IIS3DWB it works, it takes data from IIS3DWB and ISM330DHCX using CPU (traditional way) and print using uart2
